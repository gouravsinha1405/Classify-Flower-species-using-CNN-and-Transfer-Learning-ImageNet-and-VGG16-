# Classify-Flower-species-using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning-ImageNet-and-VGG16
- I built a CNN model to predict the flower class based on photos.
- Used Oxford 17 flower dataset to train the model.
- Firstly I used normal CNN to train the model and then in order to improve the F1 score used transfer learning with VGG16 and InceptionV3 along with imagenet weights.
- Also built a desktop app using Tkinter which predicts the flower class based on the image that you will upload.
